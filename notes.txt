CSS Grids quicktro

- Forget about floats and clears
- Flexible tools for easy layout
- Equal heights not a problem anymore
- Columns: horizontal, rows: vertical

- New CSS unit FR: fraction

  This unit auto-calculates the needed width. No more percents!
  1fr + 1fr = 50% 50%
  3fr + 1fr = 75% 25%
  9fr + 1fr = 90%  1%

  1fr + 1fr + 2fr = 25% 25% 50%

We can mix fixed-width units with fr units:
  grid-template-columns: 100px 3fr 1fr;
